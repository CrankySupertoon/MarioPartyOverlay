	<h1 class="specialText"> Commands for MPO</h1>
	<p class="grayText"> Here you can find a full list of all commands for 'Mario Party Overlay' (MPO). In case you want to try out MPO, go to <a href="https://blueyoshi9000.github.io/MarioPartyOverlay/">this</a> website. To download it (which is recommended), click <a href="https://github.com/blueYOSHI9000/MarioPartyOverlay/releases">here</a> <br /> <br />
		All commands are restricted to a few users, which includes all mods and a whitelist which the streamer can change. <br /> <br />
		Doesn't matter which command, it doesn't matter if your command is uppercase, lowercase or whatever because the bot converts everything to lower case, so "MaRiO" will be "mario" for the bot. <br /> <br />
		Help Command: There's a help command that should redirect you to this website (the streamer can change it so it may not be the case), you can execute it by either: "!mpo commands" or "!mpo help".

	<h3 class="specialText"> Update Counters </h3>
	<p class="grayText"> Usage: "!mpo *player* *counter* *action*" | Example: "!mpo p3 mini 34" = sets the minigame counter for player 3 to 34 <br /> <br />
		Player: Replace this with the player you want to update: player "1"-"4", it's also possible to add a "p" before the number: "p2", "p4" <br /> <br />
		Counter: Replace this with the counter you want to update (might be useful to take a look at MPO in case you don't understand exactly what one of these means, it's in the same order as on MPO): "happening"/"hap", "minigame"/"mini", "redspace"/"red", "running"/"run", "shopping"/"shop", "orb", "candy", "spinspace"/"spin", "minus"/"miniztar"/"ztar", "specialdiceblock"/"specialdice"/"dice". <br /> <br />
		Action: Here you can tell what MPO should do; to add a certain amount to a counter, use "+"/"p" and the amount to add (like "+5" or "p13"), to remove a certain amount just use "-"/"m" instead of "+". If you want to set the counter to a certain amount, just ignore +/-/p/m, only use a number.
	</p>

	<h3 class="specialText"> Update Current Turn/Coin Star: </h3>
	<p class="grayText"> Usage: "!mpo *turn/coin* *action* *character*" | Example: "!mpo turn 3" "!mpo coin 42 mario" <br /> <br />
		Action: Read the Action part of "Update Counters", it's the exact same. <br /> <br />
		Character: Only use this if your updating the coin star counter. Only required if you need to change the character holding the most coins (command works perfectly fine without this). If the image doesn't correctly pop up, someone likely did a spelling mistake. Characters: "Mario", "Luigi", "Peach", "Yoshi", "Wario", "Waluigi", "Rosalina", "Daisy", "Toad", "Toadette", "DK" ("Donkey Kong" doesn't work), "Koopa", "Boo", "Spike", "DryBones", "Blooper", "ShyGuy", "HammerBro", "Kamek", "Birdo", "KoopaKid"

	<h2 class="specialText"> Admin Commands </h2>
	<p class="grayText">
		Admins commands are a set of commands which only the mods and a whitelist created by the streamer can use. These includes changing stuff like the characters etc, they can also give other users temporary access to either normal commands or admin commands (these are removed after reloading the page tho', permament access can only be given by editing the messages.js file). <br /> <br />
		All Admin commands start with "!mpoa" instead of "!mpo", it won't work if you use the wrong one.
	</p>

	<h3 class="specialText"> Change characters: </h3>
	<p class="grayText"> Usage: "!mpoa character *player* *character* *com*" "!mpoa computer *player*" | Example: "!mpoa character p1 toad nocom" "!mpoa computer 2" <br /> <br />
		Use this command to change the character of a player, you can also change the computer status of them. <br /> <br />
		Alternative command: Instead of using "character", you can also use "char", for "computer" "com".
		Player: Read the player part of "Update Counters", it's the exact same. <br /> <br />
		Character: Change the character, characters are listed at "Update Current Turn/Coin Star". <br /> <br />
		Com: Only use this in the character command (the computer command automatically changes the computer status of a player to the opposite) and only if you want to change the computer status, the command works perfectly fine without this. Use "com"/"c" to change a player into a computer and "nocom"/"nc"/"n" to do the opposite.
	</p>

	<h3 class="specialText"> Change Max Turn: </h3>
	<p class="grayText"> Usage: "!mpoa maxturn *action*" | Example: "!mpoa maxturn 15" <br /> <br />
		Alternative command: Instead of using "maxturn" you can also use "max". <br /> <br />
		Action: Read the Action part of "Update Counters", it's the exact same.
	</p>

	<h3 class="specialText"> Enable/Disable Counters: </h3>
	<p class="grayText"> Usage: "!mpoa enable *counter*" | Example: "!mpoa enable happening" <br /> <br />
		Alternative command: Instead of using "enable" you can also use "activate" or even "disable" or "deactivate", same result since the bot checks if a counter is already activated or not. Note: Even if it says "enable" and "disable", it just changes the visibility so MPO can still count ""disabled"" counters. <br /> <br />
		Counter: Read Counter in "Update Counters", it's the exact same, except this command got two extra options: "minigamewins"/"miniwins" and "slow".
	</p>

	<h3 class="specialText"> Deactivate/Activate Highlighting/Change color of it: </h3>
	<p class="grayText"> Usage: "!mpoa highlight *option*" | Example: "!mpoa highlight #0000ff" "!mpoa highlight off" <br /> <br />
		Option: To turn highlighting on use "on", to turn it off "off". To change the color, use that. It needs to be written in the HTML color format which is "#1156ff", the characters can be from 1-9 and 1-f. And don't forget the # at the beginning!
	</p>

	<h3 class="specialText"> Add Temporary users/admins: </h3>
	<p class="grayText"> Usage: "!mpoa *command* *user*" | Example: "!mpoa adduser blueyoshi9000" "!mpoa addadmin Nightbot" "!mpoa addboth stay_hydrated_bot" <br /> <br />
		<b> Warning: Admins and users currently can't be removed from this list without reloading MPO!</b> Note: Theyre only temporary added, only the streamer can add them permamently by editing "messages.js". <br /> <br />
		Command: If the user should be added to the normal whitelist, use "adduser"; for admin "addadmin" and if he should be added as both usw "addboth". <br /> <br />
		User: It's the user! What did you expect?
