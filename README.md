# Mario Party Overlay
## What's Mario Party Overlay?
Mario Party Overlay is a highly customizable and easy to use 'Bonus Star' tracker for the Mario Party series, supporting every game in it (incl. the upcoming Mario Party Superstars once it's released -- that said, it will likely take a week or so until all the bonus stars are found and implemented). It also includes a greenscreen so it can be used in a livestream!

## How to use?
Click on the numbers to increase the counters, by holding Ctrl you can decrease them instead. The amount can be changed at the top (1, 5 or 10).  
It's possible to switch between 1 and 5/10 by holding Shift.  
To give/take the coin-star you just click on the character.

Characters and counters can both be changed at the top.

Settings can be found by clicking on the gear and then "Open Settings" (or by clicking on the gear while holding Ctrl).

A more extensive (and likely up-to-date) introduction can by found by clicking on the gear and then "Credits".

## The new Mario Party hasn't been added yet, what do?
Scream at me somewhere I see it, whether it's on [Mastodon](https://wetdry.world/@blueYOSHMIN), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/yoshmin.com), by creating a Github issue or anywhere else you find me. I'm infinitely more likely to support a newly released game by knowing someone's actually still using this lmao.

## Rewrite
There is "currently" a rewrite of this in progress. I said "currently" because I'm not exactly working on it much lmao, so don't expect it anytime soon. Doesn't mean the current version is unusable though, because the biggest reason for it is that the codebase is trash, the site itself does still work fine. You can check out the rewrite progress on the rewrite branch here.
