# How to use?
Click on the numbers to increase the counters, by holding Ctrl you can decrease them instead. The amount can be changed at the top (1, 5 or 10).  
It's possible to switch between 1 and 5 by holding Shift, if one of the two is selected.  
To give/take the coin-star you just click on the character.

The "Generate & Copy" button outputs all stats as text and copies it.  
The Save/Reload buttons well... save and reload! It saves all stats and reloads them. If activated in the settings, they will be saved in your browser too and automatically loaded the next time you open the site.

Note: All settings are applied immediately, the save button will only save it permanently as otherwise they get reset when you refresh the site.
