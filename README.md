# What's Mario Party Overlay?
Mario Party Overlay is a (offline-)website to display which character gets the bonus stars in the Mario Party games 1-10 and DS. It's also possible to include this in a Stream through OBS or other streaming software.  
**Tutorial is on the site itself**

## Download
You can download this through Github, however, then you still require internet since some files aren't included here and instead load them from a different website.
